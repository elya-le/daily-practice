# Practice Discipline Framework

## STRICT TIMING: 60 minutes total per problem

### Phase 1: Problem Analysis (15 minutes)

# **Step 1: Read & Restate (5 minutes)**
# - Read problem 3 times
# - Write in ONE sentence:
# This problem asks me to...
# - List inputs: type, format, constraints
#
# - List outputs: type, format, what it represents

# - List ALL constraints (array length, value ranges, etc.)


# Problem Understanding:
# "Let me restate the problem: [restate in your words]"
# "The input is [describe] and I need to return [describe]"
# "Key constraints are [list most important ones]


**Step 2: Example Breakdown (5 minutes)**
# - Input: [copy exactly]
# - Output: [copy exactly]
# - Manual trace: "Given [input], I transform it by [specific steps] to get [output]"
# - Identify the core transformation happening

**Step 3: Pattern & Approach (5 minutes)**
# - Problem type: [Array/String/Tree/Graph/DP/Math/etc.]
# - Similar problems: [name specific ones if any]
# - Data structures needed: [be specific - HashMap, Stack, etc.]
# - Algorithm family: [Two Pointers, Sliding Window, DFS, BFS, etc.]

### Phase 2: Solution Design (15 minutes)

**Step 4: High-Level Strategy (5 minutes)**
# Write exactly 3-5 bullet points:
# - Main approach in one sentence
# - Key insight or trick
# - Time complexity: O(?)
# - Space complexity: O(?)

**Step 5: Detailed Steps (10 minutes)**
# Number each step:
# 1. [Initialization - what variables, what values]
# 2. [Main logic - loop/recursion structure]
# 3. [Processing - what happens each iteration]
# 4. [Termination - when to stop, what to return]

### Phase 3: Implementation (20 minutes)

**Step 6: Pseudocode (5 minutes)**
```
function solutionName(input):
    // 1. Initialize: variable = value
    // 2. Loop: for/while condition
    // 3. Process: if/else logic
    // 4. Return: result
```

**Step 7: Code (15 minutes)**
- Write actual code
- Say out loud: "I'm creating variable X to track Y because Z"
- For each line, state WHY you're writing it

### Phase 4: Verification (10 minutes)

**Step 8: Test with Example (5 minutes)**
- Use given example
- Trace through EVERY line of your code
- Write down variable values at each step
- Verify final output matches expected

**Step 9: Edge Cases (5 minutes)**
Test these systematically:
- Empty input
- Single element
- All same elements
- Maximum constraints
- Minimum constraints

## Interview Simulation Script

**Problem Understanding:**
"Let me restate the problem: [restate in your words]"
"The input is [describe] and I need to return [describe]"
"Key constraints are [list most important ones]"

**Approach Explanation:**
"My approach is to [high-level strategy]"
"I'll use [data structure] because [reason]"
"The main insight is [key observation]"
"Time complexity will be [X] because [reason]"

**Implementation Walkthrough:**
"I'll initialize [variable] to track [purpose]"
"In my main loop, I'll [describe logic]"
"This condition handles [specific case]"

**Testing:**
"Let me trace through the example..."
"With input [X], my algorithm does [step by step]"

## Absolute Rules

1. **TIMER IS SACRED** - Stop at 60 minutes regardless of completion
2. **NO GOOGLING** - No searches, no hints, no AI during the 60 minutes
3. **WRITE EVERYTHING** - If you think it, write it down
4. **SPEAK OUT LOUD** - Verbalize your reasoning constantly
5. **NO CODE UNTIL STEP 6** - Follow the sequence exactly

## Daily Targets

**Week 1-2: Easy Problems**
- Focus: Following the framework perfectly
- Goal: Complete all 9 steps within 60 minutes
- Success metric: Can explain approach clearly

**Week 3-6: Medium Problems**
- Focus: Recognizing patterns quickly
- Goal: Solve 70% within time limit
- Success metric: Can optimize after first solution

**Week 7+: Mixed Difficulty**
- Focus: Interview simulation
- Goal: Solve under pressure
- Success metric: Can explain while coding

## Emergency Protocols

**If stuck for 5+ minutes:**
1. Go back to examples - trace manually
2. Simplify the problem - solve smaller version
3. Try brute force first - optimize later

**If can't code the solution:**
1. Write pseudocode more detailed
2. Code one small piece at a time
3. Test each piece separately

**If running out of time:**
1. Prioritize working solution over optimization
2. Explain what you would do to optimize
3. Don't panic - partial credit is better than nothing

## Success Metrics

- **Week 1:** Follow framework 100% of time
- **Week 2:** Solve 80% of easy problems
- **Week 4:** Solve 60% of medium problems
- **Week 6:** Explain solution clearly while coding
- **Week 8:** Handle follow-up questions confidently

The goal is THINKING DISCIPLINE, not just correct answers.
