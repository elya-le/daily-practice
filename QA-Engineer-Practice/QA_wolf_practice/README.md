I originally saw the job listing for the QA Wolf Engineer position in July 
But did not feel prepared enough to apply at that time having no Playright experience.
Since further researching QA Wolf, thier philosophies, approach and company culture from what I could find online...
I knew that I wanted to spend more time on this application than other companies...
Not that I don't put care into the applications of other companies
I just see how much thought and time QA Wolf puts into designing thier product, systems, as well as time and 
the intention they put into their hiring process and I wanted to match 
and or exceed that level of effort and intentionality.


Here is my documentation of my process of refreshing my JavaScript skills and studying for the technical assessment...
even though I have not yet submitted the take home challenge or reached the point of applying for the position. 
there is no time lost in preparing and documenting for something I want to do and a career want to grow into.
